                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a Sophomore at Clemson University, where I am working towards my degree in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>My passion for Computer Science began in my Junior year of High Schools, where I was introduced to programming through the Vex Robotics Competition.</p>
                <p>Ever since, I have been hooked on learning all that I can about Computers, how they work, and what they can do.</p>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <a href="projects\unwhelm\unwhelm.html">Unwhelm</a>
                <p>Unwhelm is a to-do list with a twist. It takes all of the tasks that you have to do, and presents them on at the time to stop you from being overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>I have several more projects currently in the works!</p>
